# **Movie-Search**
## What am I looking at?

The idea for this project came from my love of films and over use of IMDB to see who that person is and "what do we know them from?"

I set out to create a movie/tv search that let you see more information on what you are watching, but most importantly, being able to see the actor as the character they were portraying. The reason behind this was if there is heavy prosthetics, CGI characters or animation it's hard to tell where that voice is coming from. By selecting the film of interest, then the actor or character name you are looing for, you will be able to see screenshots of the actor in their role!

But I can see them on my screen I hear you cry! Think of Pixar, Anime, the Avatar movies.. you can't always tell. You're welcome.

### What Next?

I would like to add more functionality to the app. 

* The ability to go back a step e.g. to the movie page you were on previously to look into other cast members
* Have more movies to select on the actors, pages instead of having to start a new search
* Add a slideshow to scroll through pictures in a modal
* Add related movies/similar titles to the movie information page

### Challenges

One main challenge I spent time on was trying to get one function to talk to another function to share pieces of information. In the end the simplest way was to combine the two together. From there I needed to figure out how to structure my for loop within it, so as not to loop all the other pieces of information.
